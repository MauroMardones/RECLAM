abstract = {The R package TropFishR is a new analysis toolbox compiling single-species stock assessment methods specifically designed for data-limited fisheries analysis using length-frequency data. It includes methods for (i) estimating biological stock characteristics such as growth and mortality parameters, (ii) exploring technical aspects of the fisheries (e.g. exploitation rate and selectivity characteristics), (iii) assessing size and composition of a fish stock by means of virtual population analysis (VPA), and (iv) assessing stock status with yield prediction and production models. This paper introduces the package and demonstrates the functionality of a selection of its core methods. TropFishR modernises traditional stock assessment methods by easing application and development and by combining it with advanced statistical approaches.},

The equations provide highly reliable estimates of M for any given fish stock, given the values of Woc or L'f.) and K of the von Bertalanffy growth formula, and an estimate of the mean water temperature in which the stock in question lives. Only two groups have values of M generally differing from those obtained through the proposed equations: the Clupeidae, with generally lower and the polar fishes with generally higher values. Correction factors are given for both groups. Potential appli- cations of the findings to population dynamics are discussed together with some ecological implications. Introduction},

abstract = {Abstract The development of analysis of variance (ANOVA) methodology has in turn had an influenced on the types of experimental research being carried out in many fields. ANOVA is one of the most commonly used statistical techniques, with applications across the full spectrum of experiments in agriculture, biology, chemistry, toxicology, pharmaceutical research, clinical development, psychology, social science, and engineering. The procedure involves the separation of total observed variation in the data into individual components attributable to various factors as well as those caused by random or chance fluctuation. It allows performing hypotheses tests of significance to determine which factors influence the outcome of the experiment. However, although hypothesis testing is certainly a very useful feature of the ANOVA, it is by no means the only aspect. The methodology was originally developed by Sir Ronald A. Fisher, the pioneer and innovator of the use and applications of statistical methods in experimental design who coined the name “Analysis of Variance – ANOVA.”}
